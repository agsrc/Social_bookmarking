**** instead of sql datastore.java would be used.
**** entities would become the correspond to table in the data structure (i.e book user bookmark weblink)
**** the row data would be filled by the instance of entities.(hibernate framework does that automatically).

More details--


we will implement both managers and daos as a model.

for view we would  implement View.java.

for database we would java class.

entities or classes would be created which correspond to database tables.

an the instance of entities would form the row data.
